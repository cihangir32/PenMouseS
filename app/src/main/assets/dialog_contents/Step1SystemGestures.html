    By default, the S Pen has several built-in system functions that allow it to act as a remote control for your phone.
    For example, holding down the button on the stylus typically launches the camera.
</p>

<p>
    Normally, system actions of the S Pen are not triggered in apps that actively use the stylus
    (e.g., in games like Bird Hunt). However, when using the S Pen as an Air Mouse, the pen does not recognize
    that it's inside an app, meaning all of its default system functions, gestures, and shortcuts remain active.
</p>

<p>
    To ensure the best performance of the Air Mouse mode, we recommend disabling the following S Pen features in the settings:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pointer command icon display</li>
    <li>Long press on the stylus button</li>
    <li>All available gesture actions:
        <ul>
            <li>Back</li>
            <li>Home</li>
            <li>Recent apps</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Leaving these functions enabled may cause unintended behavior while using the Air Mouse.
    Unfortunately, PenMouse S cannot detect whether you've turned these settings off,
    so we'll have to take your word for it! ðŸ˜Š
