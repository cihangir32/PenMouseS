    If the cursor doesn't move after activating Air Mouse, first make sure that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>You removed the S Pen from the phone and waited for it to connect before launching the mouse feature</li>
    <li>You're using a compatible S Pen that supports Air Actions</li>
    <li>The S Pen battery is charged</li>
    <li>You're using a compatible device:
        <ul>
            <li>Galaxy Note10</li>
            <li>S20 Ultra - S24 Ultra</li>
            <li>Galaxy Tabs with S Pen remote support</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Please Note:</strong> The S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth in the S Pen.
</p>

<p>
    If the mouse feature used to work on this device but suddenly stopped, try the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Go to Accessibility settings and toggle PenMouse S off and back on</li>
    <li>Restart your device</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If the mouse has never worked and you've followed all the steps above, then unfortunately this app most likely won't work on your device ðŸ˜•<br>
    Pen Mouse S relies on an old, long-abandoned Samsung API called S Pen Remote, which hasnâ€™t been updated in over 5 years.
    It has many limitations and bugs, and sadly thereâ€™s nothing I can do about that. Whether this app works or not is somewhat random and depends on your specific device. Sorry about that!
