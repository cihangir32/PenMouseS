<p>Hi! Welcome to PenMouse S – control your phone using the S Pen.</p>

<p><strong>First and foremost:</strong> PenMouse S is an experimental app and uses the S Pen Remote SDK, which is no longer supported by Samsung. This means there may be bugs, connection drops, or the app might not work at all with your device. I apologize for any issues, but unfortunately, some of them are beyond my ability to fix. If the app doesn’t work on your phone now, it most likely never will.</p>

<p>Please carefully follow all the steps required to prepare your phone for using Air Mouse, otherwise the app may not function properly. Also, make sure your device supports <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10003221/">S Pen Air Actions</a>.</p>

<p>
    Compatible devices:
    <ul>
        <li>Galaxy Note10</li>
        <li>S20 Ultra - S24 Ultra</li>
        <li>Galaxy Tabs with S Pen remote support</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Please Note:</strong> The S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth in the S Pen.
</p>

<p>Before enabling Air Mouse for the first time, you’ll be asked for:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Notification permission</strong> – The app sends silent status updates, like whether the cursor is active, hidden, or asleep. You can change this later in the settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility service access</strong> – This is required to display the cursor icon over all apps and system UI, and to simulate finger taps on the screen.<br>
        <strong>PenMouse S DOES NOT read or share any of your screen content.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quick usage guide:</strong></p>

<p>
    After completing all the steps, removing the S Pen from your device, waiting for it to connect successfully to your phone, and starting the Air Mouse, a cursor will appear on the screen.
    Moving the stylus will move the cursor, and pressing the S Pen button will simulate a finger tap on the screen.
</p>

<p>
    Due to system limitations, PenMouse S does not support hover effects or right-click actions.
    You can only simulate taps and gestures.
</p>

<p>
    If you put the S Pen down and the cursor stops moving, it will hide after 10 seconds (this time can be changed in the settings).
    To make the cursor reappear, simply move the S Pen.
</p>

<p>
    However, if the cursor remains hidden, after one minute the S Pen’s gyroscope will turn off to save battery.
    The cursor will no longer respond to movement. To reactivate the gyroscope, press the S Pen button – this behavior can also be changed in the settings.
</p>

<p>
    If you've enabled notifications, the app will show a status notification with the current state of the S Pen (active, hidden, sleeping).
    From the notification, you can open the app or stop the Air Mouse.
</p>

<p>
    Don’t forget to check the settings and customize the app to your preferences.
