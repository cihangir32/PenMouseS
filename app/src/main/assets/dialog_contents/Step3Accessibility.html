    Pen Mouse S requires its accessibility service to be enabled for proper functionality.
</p>

<p>
    Accessibility services are needed to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Display the cursor above other apps, including the notification panel and the lock screen</li>
    <li>Simulate touch input on the screen, mirroring S Pen movements</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Pen Mouse S does NOT read your screen content.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    You can see how to enable the accessibility service in the video below:
