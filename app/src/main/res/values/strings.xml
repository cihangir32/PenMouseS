    <string name="home_steps_1_des">Disable system S Pen gestures</string>
    <string name="home_steps_1_dialog_content">By default, the S Pen has several built-in system functions that allow it to act as a remote control for your phone. For example, holding down the button on the stylus typically launches the camera.\n\nNormally, system actions of the S Pen are not triggered in apps that actively use the stylus (e.g., in games like Bird Hunt). However, when using the S Pen as an Air Mouse, the pen does not recognize that it\'s inside an app, meaning all of its default system functions, gestures, and shortcuts remain active.\n\nTo ensure the best performance of the Air Mouse mode, we recommend disabling the following S Pen features in the settings:\n\n\u00A0‚Ä¢\u00A0Pointer command icon display\n\u00A0‚Ä¢\u00A0Long press on the stylus button\n\u00A0‚Ä¢\u00A0All available gesture actions:\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Back, Home, Recent apps, etc.\n\nHow to find these setting?\nSettings ‚Üí Advanced Features ‚Üí S Pen\n\nLeaving these functions enabled may cause unintended behavior while using the Air Mouse. Unfortunately, PenMouse S cannot detect whether you\'ve turned these settings off, so we\'ll have to take your word for it! üòä\n\nOnce you\'ve disabled them, toggle the switch and continue. \n\nIf you\'re having trouble finding the S Pen settings, check out this tutorial video:</string>
